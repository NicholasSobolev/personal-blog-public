## Honours Computer Science Student at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca)

I'm a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for building, learning, and sharing knowledge. I am currently focused on launching a B2B company that helps connect clothing brands with quality manufacturers through modern and automated systems.

Beyond business, I enjoy constantly optimizing my workflow, whether it's through Neovim, Arch Linux, and exploring new LLM'S. I have a keen interest in AI, and am currently taking courses on deep learning beyond my degree.

> taking andrew ng's deep learning specialization
> exploring content creation about productivity

Below are some blogs I like to post occasionally here. They often focus on concepts I find interesting and want to explore more deeply. Feel free to take a look!
