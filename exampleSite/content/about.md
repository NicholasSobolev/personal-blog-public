## hobbies

p.s any links are not affiliate links, just things i like

**reading** i read all genres, from fiction to non-fiction, and even some manga.  
some books in my backlog include:

> The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness by Eric Jorgenson  
> Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky  
> Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Christian Brian  
> Three Days of Happiness by Sugaru Miaki  
> Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho

**weightlifting** a key aspect of my life. I've been training for over 4 years now, and go in for at least 4 days a week. before i started, i was in taekwondo, however, after my master had left canada, my dad decided to take me into this new sport. out of all my hobbies on this list, this one has had the most profound impact on my life both physically and mentally. it is the reason why i am able to deal with new challenges and look forward to them. it has also taught me the value of consistency and hard work, which i apply to all aspects of my life.

**music** has always been a big part of my life. i listen to all genres, from rap to classical.  
below are some artists and bands id recommend:

> The Fishmans  
> Lucy Bedroque  
> Twikipedia  
> Uchu Nekoko  
> Jane Remover

**video games** since i was a kid, this is the hobby that has stuck with me the longest. throughout my life, i played a lot of competitive games such as counter-strike. in itself it is not the most productive hobby, however, what it did was bring out my competitive nature and ultimately be the best at whatever i set my mind to.

if i play games nowadays it is usually with friends or ill whip out the good old ds or vita to play during leisure time.

here are some games you should really check out!

> Persona 4  
> Sekiro Shadows Die Twice  
> Pokemon Platinum  
> Little Big Planet 2  
> Animal Crossing New Leaf

## tech i enjoy using

**keyboards** are essential for most workflows nowadays, and ive sinked some money into it. in atomic habits one of the key points is to make the habit satisfying, and for me, that is having a good keyboard. im currently using the [keychron v1 max](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v1-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) as my daily driver with ktt kang white v3 switches. however i recently ordered the [qk60](https://www.qwertykeys.com/en-ca/products/qk60-round-3) with a hkkb layout that im looking forward to building and likely switch over to.

**trackball mouse** as a programmer i spend most of my time on the keyboard, however, when i do grab the mouse it has to be efficient and fast. thats why the proto arc mouse is my go to. the ergonomics are great and the battery life has been quite good so far. when not using the proto arc, i also have [g pro x superlight](https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.html) that i sometimes use for gaming or other tasks that require a more traditional mouse.

**desktop and laptops** while at home I typically work from my pc desktop which i built a couple years back. it has 3070, a i7 12700k and 32gb of ram. its definitely a little overkill for most of the things i do nowadays. i dualboot it with windows 11 (which is pretty sucky) and arch linux. i kept windows in case i want to play some games with my friends. but 95% of the time i use arch linux, and its what im most comfortable with anyways.

i got a old t460 for free which works alright, its not amazing by any means since it is a dual core i5 with 8gb of ram but it does do most of the things i need it to do for school and work.

im planning to switch over to the panasonic cf-sv8 as my daily driver and will probably put arch on it too (duh).

**eink** devices are so great man. if you havent been able to tell already, im pretty deep into the whole productivity and efficiency thing (shouts out [james scholz](https://www.youtube.com/@jvscholz)). i currently use the onyx boox go 10.3 as the daily for writing notes, marking up pdfs, and reading books. its definitely for a certain type of audience as its quite experimental so if you dont think it worth the money then id just go for an ipad or something instead.
